## Description

This Game Engine is a personal project I developed with the intention of learning about game development and understanding how games are made from the ground up. By creating this game engine, I aimed to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to bring my own game ideas to life.

Currently, I am actively working on building a multiplayer game utilizing this game engine. I have successfully developed a chat system that enables real-time communication among players. This feature demonstrates the potential of the engine for multiplayer functionality and highlights its versatility in handling dynamic, interactive components.
